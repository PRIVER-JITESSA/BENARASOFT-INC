## Known Issues / Limitations

### üîç Recommendation Engine
The personalized recommendation feature is currently very basic and not deeply integrated. Some limitations include:
- No persistent user history or advanced tracking logic
- Lacks collaborative filtering or AI-based similarity matching
- Limited by the TMDb API's filtering capabilities for per-user preferences

### Data Persistence
"My List" and viewing history are stored in local state or localStorage and are not persisted on a backend database. This can be expanded in future iterations.
